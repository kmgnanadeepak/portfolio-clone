      <h1>
        My <span>Growth Journey</span><br />
        as a Developer
      </h1>

      <p>
        My journey into development did not begin with confidence or clarity.
        It started with confusion, self-doubt, and countless moments of questioning
        whether I was good enough to pursue this path.
      </p>

      <p>
        There were days when nothing made sense. Tutorials felt fast, errors felt endless,
        and progress felt invisible. I spent long nights debugging simple mistakes,
        often feeling stuck while others seemed to move ahead effortlessly.
      </p>

      <div class="divider"></div>

      <p>
        What changed everything was consistency. Even on days when motivation disappeared,
        I showed up. I wrote code, broke things, fixed them, and repeated the cycle.
        Slowly, confusion turned into clarity.
      </p>

      <p>
        I learned that struggle is not failure — it is proof of growth.
        Every bug sharpened my thinking. Every failed attempt strengthened my resilience.
        Instead of chasing perfection, I focused on becoming better than yesterday.
      </p>

      <p>
        Today, I carry those struggles with pride. They shaped my mindset, discipline,
        and patience. This journey is still ongoing, but now I trust the process
        and my ability to rise through every challenge ahead.
